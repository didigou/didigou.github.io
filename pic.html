  <h2>about ai generator</h2>
  <p>Since its founding, the field of machine learning has used statistical models, including generative models, to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, 
    the emergence of deep learning drove progress and research in image and video processing, 
    text analysis, speech recognition, and other tasks. However, most deep neural networks were trained as 
    discriminative models performing classification tasks such as convolutional neural network-based image classification.</p>
